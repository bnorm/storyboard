## [Basic](basic)

Shows the basics of constructing a storyboard.
The storyboard attempts to be self-describing, including how navigation and state within a Storyboard work.

## [Diagram](diagram)

Storyboards have different creative requirements than regular UIs.
Diagrams are a big part of that.
Building a responsive diagram in Compose is challenging, so there are a few utilities available to help.
This storyboard demonstrates the use of some of these utilities and how they can be combined.

## [Interactive](interactive)

Storyboards can be interactive.
They're just Compose UIs at their core!
This storyboard demonstrates a few different ways a presenter could interact with a storyboard.

## [Teleprompter](teleprompter) (desktop exclusive)

Advanced example of creating a secondary desktop display for a storyboard.
This "teleprompter" display can render additional content within the storyboard.
This can help a presenter record important notes about the presentation
or even help them interact with the storyboard itself.
